# Lamé — Kailh Low Profile Keycaps

The repository contains these folders:

- **STL** – 3D models for any CAD of Slicer software.
- **Lychee** – project files for Lychee Slicer. You might need to update model paths to edit files.
- **CTB (Mars 2 Pro)** – print-ready files for Elegoo Mars 2 Pro and Elegoo water-washable resin.
- **Assets** – folder that contain images and actual photos of keycaps.

Each of them includes three files:

- **Plain**. Just a flat keycap profile with a small recess, that soothing for fingers.
- **Tilted**. Same as Plain, but top profile has a 15° tilt and 0.5mm upward height compensation.
- **Thumb**. Same as Plain, but top profile has a cut along down side.

## How to print?

It is best to position the model more vertically to avoid tactile layer-to-layer bumps.

> Personally, I use 45° or 75° angle, but it's up to you.

## Can I use these models for a production and sale?

Yes. But you must leave a mention of this repository/author to end users.

## Can I modify, fork, post (or whatever) these models?

Yes. Rules are the same. Give a credit to the author.
